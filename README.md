In the application, there is a possibility to view detailed information about movies. By clicking on a movie that you like, you will be taken to a screen with detailed information about it. We can view the movie's rating (stars), category (horror, mystery, thriller, fantasy, etc.). A brief description of each movie will greet us under its cover. We can also add the movie to the saved list by clicking on the corresponding icon.

Saved movies and cartoons can be viewed in a separate tab located on the main screen.



There is also a search function that opens after clicking on the corresponding icon located on the main screen.

API is a source of information in the program. Everything is built on the principle that we make a request to the service and receive data about movies and other videos from it.
